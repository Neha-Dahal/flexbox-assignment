              Among the different varieties of Nepali food available, momo is
              one of the most popular items. In fact, momos are so popular in
              Nepal that almost every restaurant offers it on their menu. There
              are three steps to making momo : you will first need to prepare
              fillings, then the wrappers, and finally you can cook them. In
              this article, I'm going to teach you the authentic way to make
              delicious momo at home, all by yourself.

                To make delicious momos, start by adding one grated onion to the
                minced meat. Then, add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder to
                give the meat a bit of color. Next, add two tablespoons of salt
                to enhance the flavor of the filling. If you want your momos to
                be spicy, you can add a bit more of the two tablespoons of
                grated chili.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, add two tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste
                each to give the filling a tasty flavor. For a sour taste, add
                half a tablespoon of coriander powder to the mixture. After
                adding the spices, mix them well with the meat. To prevent the
                filling from getting too dry, add two tablespoons of vegetable
                oil and mix it again. Nepalese people love their momos with
                juicy fillings. Lastly, add some finely chopped coriander to the
                mixture and mix it well. With these steps, your momo filling
                will be delicious and flavorful.

                    Making wrappers is easier than making the fillings or even
                    the cooking part and it's fun too! Start by putting the
                    flour into a bowl. To make the momo wrappers, start by
                    putting flour into a bowl. Gradually add water to the flour,
                    a little at a time, to make dough. Knead the dough for a few
                    minutes to make it pliable and easier to use. Once the dough
                    is ready, pinch off a bit of it depending on how big you
                    want the wrapping to be. Then, take a rolling pin and roll
                    the dough as thinly as possible, into circular shapes that
                    are the size of a glass. Be sure not to make them too thin
                    or too thick.

                <h2 id="sub-heading-3">3. Cooking the momo</h2>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Now comes the most difficult part: packing and cooking the
                    momos! Take a piece of the momo wrapping and put around one
                    tablespoon of filling into the center of it. Then, pinch one
                    edge of the wrapping to the other edge and twist it. Keep
                    doing this until the filling is fully covered and make sure
                    that the wrapping completely covers the filling. Otherwise,
                    the momos may break when steamed.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    After wrapping the momos, oil the bottom of the steamer.
                    This prevents the momos from sticking to the steamer. Next,
                    put the momos in the steamer in a systematic order so that
                    they don't touch each other. Finally, steam the momos for
                    20-30 minutes, or until they are fully cooked. Once cooked,
                    serve the momos hot with some spicy sauce or chutney. With
                    these simple steps, you can make delicious and perfectly
                    steamed momos at home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's time to indulge in the deliciousness of momos. So, grab
                    your chopsticks or simply use your hands, and savor the
                    perfect combination of juicy filling and soft dough in every
                    bite. And don't forget to dip them in the spicy achaar for
                    that extra kick of flavor.
